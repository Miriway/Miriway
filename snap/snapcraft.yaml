summary: "Miriway: a graphical shell to configure for your desktop environment"
description: |
  Miriway isn’t a full featured desktop environment but it could, in principle, 
  be used to build one.

  It also isn’t fully “desktop ready” as there are quite a lot of “papercut” 
  concerns that need to be fixed in Mir.

  It does, however, provide a way to test Mir and other components of a desktop 
  environment that makes these “papercuts” visible and much more likely to be fixed.
